Time efficiency of DFS is O(V + E)
because it will go though each vertix of a graph and then explore vertixes that are reachable
DFS takes Θ(V) time


DFS(G)
for each vertex u ∈ G.V
    u.color = WHITE
    u.π = NIL
time = 0
for each vertex u ∈ G.V
    if u.color == WHITE
        DFS-VISIT(G, u)



DFS-VISIT(G, u)
time = time + 1
u.d = time
u.color = GRAY
for each vertex v in G.Adj[u]
    if v.color == WHITE
        v.π = u
	  DFS-VISIT(G, v)
time = time + 1
u.f = time
u.color = BLACK
